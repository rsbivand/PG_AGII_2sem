### Planned topics

- Introducing Spatial Econometrics
- Spatial data
- Working with spatial data
- Creating spatial weights objects
- Spatial Econometrics: Antecedents
- Economic and social research questions using spatial data
- Tests of spatial autocorrelation, model specification
- Spatial autoregressive models: conditional (CAR) and simultaneous (SAR)
- Estimation of spatial autoregressive models: methods (GMM, ML, Bayesian)
- No orthogonality between regression and autoregression coefficients
- Prediction and spatial models
- Eigenvectors and eigenvalues of graphs of relationships between cross-sectional observations

### Team projects

The teams should aim to prepare notebooks showing reasoning, code, workflow, conclusions, and should include a log of team discussions, and the conclusions should show how the team, with hindsight, might have modified the topics and workflow had more time, data, or other resources been available. 

Teams should try to limit joint team work to the 30 hours available, but team members may choose to make progress individually to tackle technical snags. The team may choose to delegate parts to team members; use of GitHub or similar to share writing of the notebook is encouraged.
